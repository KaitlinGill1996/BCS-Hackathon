The application says that I need two references. Who should these be?
Anyone who can provide a professional appraisal of your work and/or scholastic abilities and potential. This can include employers, professors, teaching assistants or lab instructors. Your references should have known you personally for some length of time, ideally one semester or longer.

Can I submit certified copies of my official documents in place of originals?
Please submit sealed, original, official, documents from the institution at which they were issued directly to UBC Admissions. Do not send transcripts to the CS Department.

Can I have official documents sent directly to the BCS (ICS) office from the institute at which they were issued?
All your transcripts and documents should be submited directly to UBC Admissions.

When will future offerings of the BCS (ICS) program take place?
We admit students to start the program in September only, and the application deadline is usually January 15 of the same year.  The deadline for referees to submit references is January 15 of the same year.
