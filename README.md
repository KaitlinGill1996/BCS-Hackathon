# BCS Hackathon

BCS Pal is a Discord AI Chatbot designed for the UBC BCS program. This chatbot serves as a virtual assistant, designed to swiftly address program-related queries to enhance accessibility and productivity for our fellow classmates and future BCS students. With the chatbot, we aim to alleviate the struggles we once faced and foster a more cohesive and supportive learning environment within our community.
